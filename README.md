Play for Keeps   
==
Play for Keeps is a game inspired by Pogs, a game that was popularized in the early 90's. The idea is that user's can sign up, create their own pogs, and play other users in a game to win their opponent's pogs.

I started this project when I was midway through my time as a student at Dev Bootcamp, and am currently revisiting this project to reflect on old code, implement new things that I've learned, and hopefully share a simple version of the game soon.
